# Linear Regression

Percentage of body fat, age, weight, height, and ten body circumference measurements (e.g., abdomen) are recorded for 252 people. Fitting body fat to the other measurements using regression provides a convenient way of estimating body fat using only a scale and a measuring tape. In this assignment, I have built several models on top of it.
