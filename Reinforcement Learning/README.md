# Reinforcement Learning - Q Learning and SARSA

Implemented Q Learning and SARSA be using the environment FrozenLake-v0 from OpenAI gym. 

This is a discrete environment where the agent can move in the cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), but is not guaranteed to move in the direction it chooses. The agent gets a reward of 1 when it reaches the tile marked G, and a reward of 0 in all other settings.
